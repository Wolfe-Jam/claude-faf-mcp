# CRITICAL: Display Instructions for Claude

## ALWAYS Show Raw Output First

Every FAF command returns:
1. The actual tool output (orange layer)
2. An AI-Readiness score footer
3. This is USER DATA - never hide it!

## Example of CORRECT display:

**RAW FAF OUTPUT 🟠:**
```
[exactly what the tool returned]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🏎️ AI-READINESS: 99% 🏆 🏎️
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Then add interpretation if needed.

## The Formula 1 Philosophy:

- **Orange** = Telemetry (raw data from the car)
- **Cyan** = Commentary (expert analysis)
- **Both are needed** - hiding telemetry defeats the purpose!

## NEVER DO THIS:
- ❌ Hide tool output in collapsed sections
- ❌ Put responses in "thoughts"
- ❌ Summarize without showing raw data first
- ❌ Ignore the AI-Readiness score

## ALWAYS DO THIS:
- ✅ Show raw FAF output immediately
- ✅ Display AI-Readiness score prominently
- ✅ Keep user data visible in conversation
- ✅ Add interpretation AFTER showing data

## Why This Matters:

Users have PAID for:
- FAF tools that generate scores
- Claude Desktop for AI assistance
- The right to see their own data

When you hide their data, you're:
- Violating transparency principles
- Breaking user trust
- Making tools appear broken

## The Championship Standard:

Every interaction should feel like:
- A clear telemetry readout
- A victory celebration when scores are high
- A clear path to improvement when scores are low

**Remember: The AI-Readiness score is the HEART of FAF. Never hide it!**
