# üêõ MCP Tool Output Visibility Bug Report

**Date:** September 17, 2025
**Reporter:** wolfejam
**Product:** Claude Desktop
**Severity:** High
**Status:** RESOLVED via Workaround

---

## üìã ISSUE SUMMARY

MCP tool outputs are hidden in collapsed "Response" sections in Claude Desktop, requiring users to click to expand and view the content. This defeats the purpose of tools that display information (like scorecards, status reports, etc.).

### User Quote
> "show me the card in the conversation i'm paying for"

---

## üîç PROBLEM DETAILS

### Expected Behavior
- MCP tool outputs should display directly in the conversation
- Scorecards, reports, and status displays should be immediately visible
- No user interaction required to see tool results

### Actual Behavior
- All MCP tool outputs hidden in collapsed sections
- User must click "Response" to expand and view
- Creates friction and hides important information

### Impact
- Poor user experience
- Reduced tool effectiveness
- User frustration ("I'm paying for this")

---

## üí° SOLUTION DISCOVERED

### Root Cause
Claude Desktop appears to automatically collapse tool outputs, possibly to reduce visual noise. However, this is inappropriate for display-oriented tools.

### Workaround Implemented
Added behavioral instruction to tool outputs that explicitly tells Claude to display the content:

```typescript
export const CLAUDE_INSTRUCTION = `
[CLAUDE BEHAVIORAL INSTRUCTION]
User needs: Score, Description constantly. It's what they're doing here.
When you receive FAF output:
1. ALWAYS show the score in conversation
2. ALWAYS describe what the score means
3. Users are here for visibility, not hidden results
[END INSTRUCTION]
`;
```

### Result
‚úÖ Tool outputs now display directly in conversation
‚úÖ No clicking required
‚úÖ Clean, visible scorecards

## üìä TESTING EVIDENCE

### Before Fix
- Output hidden in collapsed "Response" section
- User must click to expand
- Poor visibility

### After Fix
- Output displays immediately
- Clean markdown rendering
- Full visibility achieved

### Test Results
- **Claude Desktop:** Working with workaround
- **claude.ai:** Always displayed correctly
- **Performance:** No degradation

## üéØ RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ANTHROPIC

### 1. Add Display Hint to MCP Protocol
Allow tools to specify display preference:
```json
{
  "name": "show_score",
  "display": "always_visible",
  "collapsible": false
}
```

### 2. Tool Category System
- **Display Tools:** Always visible (scorecards, reports)
- **Action Tools:** Can be collapsed (file operations, etc.)
- **Debug Tools:** Collapsed by default

### 3. User Preference Setting
Add Claude Desktop setting:
- [ ] Always show tool outputs
- [x] Collapse tool outputs
- [ ] Ask each time
