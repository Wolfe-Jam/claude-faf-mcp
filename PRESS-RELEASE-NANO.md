## FAF ENGINEERS ABANDON MILLISECONDS, ENTER NANOSECOND ERA

### "Milliseconds are for Tourists" - Chief Engineer

**BREAKING:** In an unprecedented move that's sending shockwaves through the developer community, FAF Championship Engineers have officially abandoned millisecond measurements, declaring them "insufficiently precise for championship-grade telemetry."

### THE NUMBERS THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING

Traditional timing showed "0ms" operations, but FAF engineers weren't satisfied.

"Zero milliseconds? That's not zero - that's just bad telemetry," stated the FAF Racing Division. "We're operating at speeds that make milliseconds look like geological time."

**New Measurements Released:**
- `faf_check`: 427,000 nanoseconds (previously "0ms")
- `faf_score`: 2,100,000 nanoseconds (previously "2ms")
- `faf_auto`: 9,000,000 nanoseconds (previously "9ms")

### TECHNICAL BREAKTHROUGH

```javascript
// OLD TELEMETRY (Tourist Grade)
Date.now() // millisecond "precision"
Result: 0ms // LIES!

// CHAMPIONSHIP TELEMETRY
process.hrtime.bigint() // NANOSECOND TRUTH
Result: 427,000ns // THE REAL DATA
```

### INDUSTRY REACTION

"They're measuring in nanoseconds? For a Node.js application? That's... actually insane," commented a senior developer who wished to remain anonymous.

The JavaScript community has been left scrambling to understand how FAF achieved what many considered impossible: nanosecond-precision telemetry in a JavaScript runtime.

### THE WOLFEJAM DOCTRINE

"If you're not measuring in nanoseconds, you're not racing - you're touring," declared the team, channeling the wolfejam philosophy of championship-only performance.

**Key Innovation:**
- First MCP server with nanosecond telemetry
- 1000x more precise than industry standard
- Makes "sub-millisecond" sound slow

### WHAT THIS MEANS

For users: Nothing changes except bragging rights.
For developers: Everything you knew about JavaScript performance is wrong.
For competition: They're still measuring in milliseconds like it's 2019.

### OFFICIAL STATEMENT

"FAF v2.2.0 doesn't just stop faffing about - it stops faffing about at the nanosecond level. When we say championship performance, we mean it. Milliseconds are dead. Welcome to the nanosecond era."

### PERFORMANCE TARGETS UPDATED

**Old Target:** <50ms
**New Target:** <50,000,000ns
**Achieved:** <10,000,000ns

"We're not just beating our targets - we're beating them by 40 million nanoseconds."

### THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE

One FAF operation completes in the time it takes light to travel just 128 meters. That's not software - that's approaching physics limits.

### AVAILABILITY

FAF v2.2.0 with nanosecond telemetry is available now. Millisecond measurements will be maintained for "compatibility with slower tools."

### ABOUT FAF

FAF (Foundational AI-Context Format) is the championship-grade MCP server that actually stops faffing about. Now with nanosecond precision, because milliseconds are for amateurs.
