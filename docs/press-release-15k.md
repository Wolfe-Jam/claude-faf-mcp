# FAF: The IANA-Registered Format Powering AI Context

**15,000+ npm downloads | MIT License | MCP Protocol Native**

## The Problem We Solved

Every AI conversation starts the same way: "Let me explain my project..."

Developers waste hours re-explaining their codebase to AI assistants. Context gets lost between sessions. Teams duplicate effort. AI works blind.

**FAF fixes this.**

---

## What is FAF?

**FAF (Foundational AI-context Format)** is the first IANA-registered format specifically designed for AI context delivery.

```
MIME Type: application/vnd.faf+yaml
Status: IANA Registered
License: MIT (Free & Open Source)
```

One file. Complete project understanding. Works with any AI.

## Universal Compatibility

FAF works everywhere:

```
Claude Desktop  →  .faf  →  MCP Protocol
Claude Code     →  .faf  →  MCP Protocol
xAI Grok        →  .faf  →  Native/Embed
Gemini CLI      →  .faf  →  CLI tested/approved

## The Mk3 Tier System

AI-Readiness scoring that actually means something:

| Score | Tier | What It Means |
|-------|------|---------------|
| 100% | 🏆 Trophy | Perfect AI context |
| 99%+ | 🥇 Gold | Exceptional |
| 95%+ | 🥈 Silver | Excellent |
| 85%+ | 🥉 Bronze | Production ready |
| 70%+ | 🟢 Green | Solid foundation |
| 55%+ | 🟡 Yellow | Needs improvement |
| <55% | 🔴 Red | AI working blind |

At 55%, you're flipping a coin with AI assistance.

## Why IANA Registration Matters

IANA registration means FAF is:
- **Official** - Recognized internet standard
- **Permanent** - Won't disappear or change arbitrarily
- **Universal** - Any tool can implement support
- **Professional** - Enterprise-ready from day one

`application/vnd.faf+yaml` is the MIME type for AI context.
