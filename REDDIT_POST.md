## Title
üß°‚ö°Ô∏è I built an MCP server for .faf context - 94.4/100 evaluation score (Free & Open Source)

## Post Body

Hey r/ClaudeAI! I've been working on a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that solves a problem I kept running into: having to re-explain my projects to Claude in every conversation.

### What is it?

**claude-faf-mcp** - An MCP server that gives Claude instant, persistent understanding of your projects through `.faf` files (Project DNA for AI).

### Why I built it

- Tired of re-uploading files every conversation
- Wanted consistent context across sessions
- Needed a universal format that works with ANY AI (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)
- Wanted Championship-grade performance (<11ms)

### Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Zero Config** - Works out of the box with Claude Desktop
- ‚úÖ **33+ Tools** - Complete project management (faf_auto, faf_score, faf_sync, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **<11ms Speed** - F1-inspired performance
- ‚úÖ **100% TypeScript Strict** - Type-safe, production-ready
- ‚úÖ **730 C.O.R.E Tests** - Comprehensive validation
- ‚úÖ **94.4/100 Evaluation Score** - Gold Standard quality

### How it works

1. Install: `npm install -g claude-faf-mcp`
2. Add to Claude Desktop config
3. Drop any file into Claude
4. Type: "Run faf_auto to analyze this project"
5. Claude now understands your entire codebase!

The `.faf` file persists across conversations - no more re-explaining your project structure, tech stack, or context.

### Championship Scoring System

One of the coolest features is the AI-readiness scoring with F1-inspired tiers:

```
üèÜ Trophy (100%)    - Perfect AI|HUMAN balance
ü•á Gold (99%)       - Gold standard
ü•à Silver (95-98%)  - Excellence
ü•â Bronze (85-94%)  - Production ready
üü¢ Green (70-84%)   - Good foundation
üü° Yellow (55-69%)  - Getting there
üî¥ Red (0-54%)      - Needs attention
```

Claude shows you real-time progress bars and tells you exactly what to improve to level up.
