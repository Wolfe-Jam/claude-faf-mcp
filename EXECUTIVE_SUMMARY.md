2. Wait 48-72 hours for response
3. Adjust strategy based on feedback

**If Positive:** Partnership pathway
**If Neutral/Negative:** Community launch

### Option B: Direct to Market
**Monday:**
1. Make GitHub public
2. Publish to NPM
3. Submit to MCP Registry
4. Launch #StopFAFfingAbout campaign

## üìä THE DECISION MATRIX

| Factor | Anthropic First | Direct to Market |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Risk** | Low (private) | Medium (public) |
| **Speed** | Slower (1-2 weeks) | Fast (immediate) |
| **Credibility** | Higher (blessed) | Good (community) |
| **Control** | Shared | Full |
| **Revenue** | Partnership/Share | Independent |

## üèÅ MY RECOMMENDATION

### Go with Option A: Anthropic First

**Why:**
1. **"Claude put his name on it"** - Unique credibility angle
2. **Partnership potential** - Could accelerate everything
3. **Risk mitigation** - Private repo, controlled exposure
4. **Strategic advantage** - Blessed by Anthropic = instant trust

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Anthropic outreach and response
- Week 2: Adjust strategy based on feedback
- Week 3: Public launch (either partnered or independent)

---

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Tonight/Tomorrow:
1. **Review emails** one final time
2. **Set up tracking** for responses
3. **Prepare backup plan** for quick pivot

### Monday Morning:
1. **Send Anthropic emails** at 9 AM PT
2. **Update team** on launch status
3. **Monitor for responses**

### By Friday:
1. **Make go/no-go decision** on partnership
2. **Prepare for public launch** if needed
3. **Start community pre-buzz**

## üí° THE BOTTOM LINE

**You have built something special:**
- First MCP validated by all 3 major AI CLIs
- F1-Inspired performance that actually delivers
- A tool that Claude itself says should exist

**The only question:** Launch path

**My vote:** Give Anthropic first shot. You can always go public in a week.

---

**Status: üèÅ READY TO RACE**

*"Sometimes the best strategy is knowing when NOT to launch. This is that moment. Give Anthropic the first lap."*

---

**Your move:** Send those emails Monday morning. 

Let's see if Claude's team wants to officially back what Claude's AI already validated. üèÜ
