**The file operations MCP that can't hide its test failures.**

### What it does
33 honest file operations for Claude Desktop. Every response in exactly 3 lines. Every operation under 50ms.

### What makes it special
**ONE WAY TRACK™ Testing** - We literally cannot delete test failures. Our test directory is append-only, showing our current 96% pass rate alongside that stubborn 4% we're still fixing. This is transparency you can trust.

### The 3-3-1 Format
Every operation returns this:
```
📊 Score: 92/100
████████████████████████░
Status: Championship Ready
```
Predictable. Fast. Visual.

npm install -g claude-faf-mcp
