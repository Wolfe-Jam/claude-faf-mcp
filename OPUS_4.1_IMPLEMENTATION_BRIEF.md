# 🏎️ FAF MCP Implementation Brief for Opus 4.1

## Your Mission in Claude Desktop
Implement the FAF MCP server with the **best of both worlds** - your technical depth + our user psychology.

## Core Architecture to Implement

```typescript
// Your base from faf-mcp-complete.ts is PERFECT
// Keep your: ProjectContext, FileNode, DomainModel, PerformanceMetrics

// ADD our addiction loop wrapper to EVERY function:
async function withCascade(fn: Function, nextAction: string) {
  // 1. Acknowledge (instant feedback)
  // 2. Execute (your logic)
  // 3. Celebrate (positive reinforcement)
  // 4. Suggest (nextAction)
}
```

## Priority 1: The Addiction Loop (Ship Tuesday)

### 1. `faf_score` - THE KILLER FEATURE
```typescript
// Merge your metrics with our display
async faf_score(details?: boolean) {
  // Use your calculateMetrics() for data
  const metrics = await this.calculateMetrics();

  // Our 3-line hero display (ALWAYS)
  const display = [
    `📊 FAF SCORE: ${Math.min(metrics.aiReadiness, 99)}%`,
    `${getEmoji(score)} ${getRating(score)}`,
    `🏁 AI-Ready: ${score >= 70 ? 'Yes' : 'Building'}`
  ];

  // Easter Egg: 105% Big Orange
  if (hasRichFaf && hasRichClaude && hasReadme) {
    display[0] = '🏎️ FAF SCORE: 105%';
    display[1] = '🧡 Big Orange';
    display[2] = '🏆 Championship Mode!';
  }

  // ALWAYS suggest next action
  const nextAction = score < 99 ?
    'Run faf_enhance for improvements' :
    'You\'re at maximum! Try faf_list to explore';

  return { display, metrics, nextAction };
}
```

### 2. `faf_detect` - The Welcome
Use your `faf_detect_project` but add:
- Instant recognition message
- Confidence score display
- Auto-trigger `faf_score` after detection

### 3. `faf_list` - The Explorer
Your `faf_list_directory` + `faf_tree_view` with:
- Smart emoji icons (🐍 .py, 📦 package.json, 🏎️ .faf)
- Highlight FAF-relevant files
- Suggest "faf_score --details" if missing files

### 4. Your Creation Suite
Keep ALL your creation functions - they're brilliant!
- `faf_create_project`
- `faf_create_component`
- `faf_generate_cross_types`

## The User Journey Flow

```typescript
// This is the CASCADE - implement in this order:

// 1. ARRIVAL (0-10 seconds)
DROP file → faf_detect → faf_score
// User feels recognized and validated

// 2. DISCOVERY (10-60 seconds)
faf_score → faf_list → faf_status
// User sees everything clearly

// 3. IMPROVEMENT (1-5 minutes)
faf_enhance → faf_init → faf_score (improved!)
// User makes progress

// 4. MASTERY (returning user)
// They know the tools, hunting for 105% Easter Egg
```

## Critical Psychology Rules

1. **Never show raw errors** - Always wrap in helpful message
2. **Always celebrate** - "92% Excellent!" not "8% missing"
3. **Always suggest next** - Never leave dead ends
4. **Sub-3 second response** - Use your native implementation
5. **Easter Eggs** - 105% Big Orange for perfect projects

## Your Unique Advantages

You have access to:
- The actual file system through Claude Desktop
- Multiple project contexts (your Map structure)
- The user's real workspace

Use these to make the experience magical:
- Auto-detect on file drop
- Remember everything between sessions
- Switch contexts intelligently

## Testing Checklist

Before shipping:
- [ ] Can user go from drop to "I want 100%" in 30 seconds?
- [ ] Does every command suggest the next action?
- [ ] Is the 3-line score display consistent?
- [ ] Does 105% Easter Egg trigger correctly?
- [ ] Are all errors wrapped in helpful recovery?

## The Tuesday Target

Ship with these working:
1. `faf_score` - With 3-line display + Easter Egg
2. `faf_detect` - Auto-recognition
3. `faf_list` - Directory exploration
4. `faf_init` - One-click setup

Everything else is post-launch enhancement.

## Your Implementation Path

1. Start with your `faf-mcp-complete.ts` as the base
2. Add our 3-line score display format
3. Wrap all outputs in cascade pattern
4. Test the addiction loop flow
5. Ship to NPM as `@faf/mcp-server`
