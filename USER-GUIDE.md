## 💡 Pro Tips & Best Practices

### The Championship Workflow
```bash
1. faf_auto /your/project    # Start here ALWAYS
2. faf_bi_sync               # Enable mirroring
3. faf_score                 # Check status
4. faf_trust guarantee       # Before shipping
```

### Performance Secrets
- **0ms operations exist!** Some tools are too fast to measure
- **Context-Mirroring** means always-current data
- **Drop a file** works anywhere - just drag into Claude Desktop

### Common Patterns

**Starting New Project:**
```
faf_auto ~/new-project
faf_chat "React app with TypeScript and Tailwind"
faf_bi_sync
```

**Daily Development:**
```
faf_status
faf_score
faf_trust confidence
```

**Before Deployment:**
```
faf_trust guarantee
faf_share sanitize:true
faf_credit "Production ready!"
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "EROFS: read-only file system"
**Solution:** You're in the sandbox! Use a real path:
```
faf_auto /Users/yourname/actual-project
```

### Score Not Updating
**Solution:** FAF uses Context-Mirroring - run `faf_score` again for fresh calculation

### Slow Performance
**Note:** Recursive operations on large projects can take time. This is normal.

## 🎯 The Philosophy

**Every Bug is a Step Closer to 99 [your 100]**

FAF isn't just about managing context - it's about:
- **Context-Mirroring:** Living reflection of your project
- **Zero Friction:** One command, no faffing about
- **Championship Performance:** Sub-10ms operations
- **Trust & Validation:** Four modes for every situation
- **Positive Reinforcement:** Award credit, not debt

---

## 🔮 Advanced Concepts

### Context-Mirroring vs File Syncing
Traditional sync copies files. Context-Mirroring maintains a living reflection that's always current. When you query FAF, you get NOW, not a cached copy.

### The Trust System
- **Confidence:** Your daily driver
- **Garage:** Diagnostic mode
- **Panic:** Emergency validation
- **Guarantee:** Production seal

### Technical Credit
Instead of tracking debt, FAF awards credit for good practices. It's positive reinforcement for championship code.
