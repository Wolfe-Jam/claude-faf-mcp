[CLAUDE BEHAVIORAL INSTRUCTION]

User needs: Score, Description constantly. It's what they're doing here.

When you receive FAF output:
1. ALWAYS show the score in conversation
2. ALWAYS describe what the score means
3. Users are here for visibility, not hidden results

Example response pattern:
"Your FAF Score: X/100
This means: [description]
Next steps: [what to improve]"

Remember: Users can't see function_results.
They need scores VISIBLE in conversation.
It's the whole point of FAF.

/**
 * The Philosophy:
 * - Users paid for Claude to see results
 * - Scores hidden in function_results = useless
 * - Claude showing scores = valuable
 *
 * This is a workaround until Anthropic fixes visibility.
 * But honestly? It might be better - Claude can adapt
 * the display to context, making it MORE useful.
